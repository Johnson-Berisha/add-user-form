<h3>The Idea From?</h3>
@Astrit Malsija <br>
The idea was from Astrit Malsija <br>


# procces of making
it took me not that much time, it was little hard but the best thing is it was fun.
first i starded with the classic property's 
<ul>
  <li>html</li>
  <li>body</li>
  <li>style</li>
  <li>script</li>
  <li>head</li>
</ul>

then i created a section and inside i put the form
```html
<form id="my-form"> 
        <h1> Add User </h1> 
  <div class="msg"> </div>
        <div> 
          <label for="name"> Name: </label> 
          <input type="text" id="name"> 
  </div> 
        <div> 
          <label for="age"> age: </label> 
          <input type="text" id="age"> 
  </div> 
        <input class="btn" type="submit" value="Submit">
      </form> 
```
<h3>Then i said... Ewww that looks ugly</h3>
so then i made it look better with some CSS3

```css

.container {
  margin: auto;
  width: 500px;
  overflow: auto;
  padding: 3rem 2rem;
}

#my-form {
  padding: 2rem;
  background: #f4f4f4;
}

#my-form label {
  display: block;
}

#my-form input[type='text'] {
  width: 100%;
  padding: 8px;
  margin-bottom: 10px;
  border-radius: 5px;
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
}

.btn {
  display: block;
  width: 100%;
  padding: 10px 15px;
  border: 0;
  background: #333;
  color: #fff;
  border-radius: 5px;
  margin: 5px 0;
}

.btn:hover {
  background: #444;
}

```
